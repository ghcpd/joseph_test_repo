create a python calculator app

Prompt:
Create a Python program that implements a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator should support basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Use a standard Python GUI library such as Tkinter or PyQt. The interface should include:

A display area to show the current input and result

Buttons for digits (0–9)

Buttons for basic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)

A button to clear the input

A button to calculate the result (=)

Make sure the program runs as a standalone script and opens a working calculator window when executed.


How to run:
- Run: python3 calculator.py
- Optional headless test (for CI): python3 calculator.py --test "2+3*4" (prints the result without opening a window)

See calculator_screenshot.png for a preview of the UI captured in a headless X environment.
