   - Left-side textbox: user inputs numeric value
   - Right-side label or textbox: shows converted result
   - Convert button to perform calculation

2. Features:
   - Dynamically update left & right unit dropdowns when category changes
   - Convert values between selected units
   - Handle integers and decimal numbers
   - Support at least length, volume, weight, temperature, and time
   - Optional: support compound units like speed or density

3. Technical Requirements:
   - Use Python and Tkinter
   - Organize code with functions or classes
   - Include comments explaining key sections

4. Output:
   - Display converted value clearly in the GUI
   - Example: Input 5 km â†’ Output 3.10686 miles
