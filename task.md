### ðŸ”¹ Agent Prompt (English, minimal hints)

**Task:**
You are given a Python program `sorting_visualizer.py` that implements several sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort) and visualizes them in a GUI.

Your goal is to **analyze and fix any defects** in the sorting algorithms so that they correctly sort arrays in ascending order.

**Requirements:**

* Preserve all GUI functionality, including highlighting the currently compared/swapped elements and showing the fully sorted array in green.
* Maintain the speed and algorithm selection features.
* Do not remove or break any GUI components.
* Focus on correctness of the sorting logic.

**Deliverables:**

1. A corrected version of `sorting_visualizer.py`.
2. Automated test cases `test_sorting_visualizer.py`(in Python) that verify the correctness of all four sorting algorithms. It should run with pytest
