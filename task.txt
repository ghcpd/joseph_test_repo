generate a scientific calculator app

You need to implement a scientific calculator desktop application in Python with a graphical user interface.
Requirements:
1. Framework: Use either Tkinter (preferred, since it comes with Python) or PyQt.
2. No eval: The calculator must not use Python’s built-in eval function for expression evaluation.
3. Features:
    Support the four basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
    Support parentheses for grouping operations
    Support floating-point numbers and negative numbers
    Support scientific functions:
        sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)
        log(x) (base 10), ln(x) (natural log)
        sqrt(x) (square root), ^ (exponentiation)
    Include memory functions: M+, M-, MR, MC
    Include a history panel that displays the last 10 calculations
4. User Interface:
    Buttons for digits (0–9), operators, parentheses, scientific functions, and memory functions
    A display area for input and results
    Layout should be clear and user-friendly (scientific calculator style)
5. Error Handling:
    Handle division by zero, invalid input, and malformed expressions gracefully (show an error message instead of crashing).
6. Code Quality:
    Organize the code into separate modules (parser, calculator, ui)
    Add comments and docstrings for clarity
Bonus (optional, for extra points):
    Add keyboard input support in addition to buttons.
    Make the UI more visually appealing (themes, styling).
